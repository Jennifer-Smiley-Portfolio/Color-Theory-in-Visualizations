# Color-Theory-in-Visualizations
The study of color theory is essential because it allows for visualizations to properly portray
the data while appealing to the viewers ethos to make them agree with the visualization. This
paper will explain what color theory is, how it applies to color deficiencies and visualizations.
I used Python to understand the COVID-19 data that was used to further explain how color
theory is used in practice. The main finding of this paper is that ethos is very important for
portraying the right emotion tied to the visual and it will help persuade people into feeling
a certain way about a topic. This is crucial for those who are interested in visualizations so
they can see how to properly create strong, ethos appealing, visualizations while still being
conscientious of those with color deficiencies.
